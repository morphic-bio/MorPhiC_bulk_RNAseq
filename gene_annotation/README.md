## C2: curated gene sets
Gene sets in this collection are curated from various sources, including online pathway databases and the biomedical literature. Many sets are also contributed by individual domain experts. The gene set page for each gene set lists its source. The C2 collection is divided into the following two sub-collections: Chemical and genetic perturbations (CGP) and Canonical pathways (CP). details  

## C5: ontology gene sets
Gene sets that contain genes annotated by the same ontology term. The C5 collection is divided into two sub-collections, the first derived from the Gene Ontology resource (GO) which contains BP, CC, and MF components and a second derived from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)
